==============
Last updated: February 21, 2023

Mochii Life is committed to protecting your privacy and collecting only the minimum amount of info needed to provide our software and services (including the apps "Hi My Name") â€” referred to as "Services". Your use of the Services indicates you agree to this policy and our terms of use.

# Summary

Nothing in this policy contradicts the following statements:

- We don't collect any of your personal info, including your IP address, other than information you voluntarily provide.
- We don't sell your personal info to advertisers or other third parties.

# Complete terms

As used in this policy, "Personal Info" is data that can identify a particular person or device. Aggregate data isn't considered Personal Info.

## 1. Mochii Life never collects your Personal Info except to communicate with you

Our Services don't collect any of your Personal Info, such as your IP address or geo-location information.

We may request your email address or a username to communicate with you. This info is used only as you'd expect and deleted upon request.

Optionally, you may choose to provide your email address and communicate with us via email.

## 2. Mochii Life never sells your email address or any other Personal Info you volunteer

We don't receive payment in cash or in kind from third parties in exchange for your Personal Info. Further, we don't allow third parties to collect info about you in our Services.

## 3. Mochii Life shares your Personal Info only in specific circumstances

There are a few, rare circumstances when we may have to share your Personal Info either to obey the law or protect our rights. We'll share your Personal Info only to comply with laws or legally enforceable requests, to enforce our own rights and contracts with users or third parties, or to prevent harm to others and their property in an emergency situation.

In all instances, we'll share the minimum info necessary to meet the immediate need and inform you of our disclosure when legally and practically possible.

## 4. Mochii Life retains the Personal Info you volunteer for one month or less

We remove your Personal Info from our records within 30 days of any request to do so.

## 5. Transparency report

As explained above, we will comply with a request for user data when the law requires it, but we require valid legal process to compel the disclosure of user data to the government; such as a legitimate and properly scoped court order, or a search warrant supported by probable cause and issued by an appropriate law enforcement authority. We interpret requests narrowly, and we will oppose unlawful or overbroad requests for specific user data.

# Links to Other Websites

Our Services may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.

We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

We will let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on Our Service, prior to the change becoming effective and update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
